# Stopwatch Application

This is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch, tracking both seconds and milliseconds in real-time.

## Features
- **Start**: Begin timing with the "Start" button.
- **Stop**: Pause the stopwatch with the "Stop" button.
- **Reset**: Reset the timer to `00:00` with the "Reset" button.
- **Real-Time Timing**: The stopwatch tracks time with accuracy, displaying seconds and milliseconds.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles the layout, buttons, and visual effects.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the stopwatch functionality (start, stop, and reset) with interval-based timekeeping.

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file with the structure for the stopwatch.
2. `style.css`: Contains the styling rules, including the layout and animation for buttons.
3. `script.js`: JavaScript file that powers the stopwatch logic.
